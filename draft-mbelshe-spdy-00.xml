    <abstract>
      <t>This document describes SPDY, a protocol designed for low-latency transport of content over the World Wide Web.  SPDY introduces two layers of protocol.  The lower layer is a general purpose framing layer which can be used atop a reliable transport (likely TCP) for multiplexed, prioritized, and compressed data communication of many concurrent streams.  The upper layer of the protocol provides HTTP-like semantics for compatibility with existing HTTP application servers.</t>
    </abstract>
  </front>

  <middle>
    <section anchor="intro" title="Overview">
      <t>One of the bottlenecks of HTTP implementations is that HTTP relies on multiple connections for concurrency. This causes several problems, including additional round trips for connection setup, slow-start delays, and connection rationing by the client, where it tries to avoid opening too many connections to any single server.  HTTP pipelining helps some, but only achieves partial multiplexing.  In addition, pipelining has proven non-deployable in existing browsers due to intermediary interference.</t>

      <t>SPDY adds a framing layer for multiplexing multiple, concurrent streams across a single TCP connection (or any reliable transport stream).  The framing layer is optimized for HTTP-like request-response streams, such that applications which run over HTTP today can work over SPDY with little or no change on behalf of the web application writer.</t>

      <t>The SPDY connection offers four improvements over HTTP:
        <list>
          <t>Multiplexed requests: There is no limit to the number of requests that can be issued concurrently over a single SPDY connection.</t>
          <t>Prioritized requests: Clients can request certain resources to be delivered first.  This avoids the problem of congesting the network channel with non-critical resources when a high-priority request is pending.</t>
          <t>Compressed headers:  Clients today send a significant amount of redundant data in the form of HTTP headers.  Because a single web page may require 50 or 100 subrequests, this data is significant.</t>
          <t>Server pushed streams:  Server Push enables content to be pushed from servers to clients without a request.</t>
        </list>
      </t>

      <t>SPDY attempts to preserve the existing semantics of HTTP. All features such as cookies, ETags, Vary headers, Content-Encoding negotiations, etc work as they do with HTTP; SPDY only replaces the way the data is written to the network.</t>

      <section title="Document Organization">
        <t>The SPDY Specification is split into two parts: <xref target="FramingLayer">a framing layer</xref>, which multiplexes a TCP connection into independent, length-prefixed frames, and <xref target="HTTPLayer">an HTTP layer</xref>, which specifies the mechanism for overlaying HTTP request/response pairs on top of the framing layer. While some of the framing layer concepts are isolated from the HTTP layer, building a generic framing layer has not been a goal. The framing layer is tailored to the needs of the HTTP protocol and server push.</t>

        <t>The SPDY framing layer runs atop a reliable transport layer such as <xref target="RFC0793">TCP</xref>. The client is the TCP connection initiator. SPDY connections are persistent connections.</t>

        <t>For best performance, it is expected that non-battery operated clients will leave open connections until the user navigates away from all web pages referencing the connection, or until the server closes the connection. Servers are encouraged to leave connections open for as long as possible, but can terminate idle connections if necessary.  When either endpoint closes the transport-level connection, it MUST first send a <xref target="GOAWAY">GOAWAY</xref> frame so that the endpoints can reliably determine if requests finished before the close. It is expected that battery-operated clients may have more involved heuristics as to when a connection should be closed.</t>

        <t>Upon establishment of a TCP connection and determination 
          that SPDY will be used by both peers to communicate, each

          <xref target="SETTINGS">SETTINGS frame</xref>.  The client sends the client connection header
          immediately upon receipt of a 101 Switching Protocols response (indicating a successful
          upgrade), or after receiving a TLS Finished message from the server. If starting an
          SPDY connection with prior knowledge of server support for the protocol, the client
          connection header is sent upon connection establishment.

            <t>
              The client connection header is selected so that a large proportion of HTTP/1.1 or
              HTTP/1.0 servers and intermediaries do not attempt to process further frames.  Note
              that this does not address the concerns raised in <xref target="TALKING"/>.

          The server connection header consists of just 
          a <xref target="SETTINGS">SETTINGS frame</xref> that MUST be the 
          first frame the server sends in the SPDY connection.
        </t>
        <t>
          To avoid unnecessary latency, clients are permitted to send 
          additional frames to the server immediately after sending the client 
          connection header, without waiting to receive the server connection header.
          It is important to note, however, that the server connection header 
          SETTINGS frame might include parameters that necessarily alter 
          how a client is expected to communicate with the server. Upon 
          receiving the SETTINGS frame, the client is expected to honor any 
          parameters established. 
        </t>
        <t>
          Clients and servers MUST terminate the TCP connection if either
          peer does not begin with a valid connection header.  A

       <t>
          A "stream" is an independent, bi-directional sequence of frames 
          exchanged between the client and server within a SPDY connection.
          Streams have several important characteristics:
          <list style="symbols">
            <t>
              Streams can be established and used unilaterally or shared by 
              either the client or server.
            </t>
            <t>
              Streams can be rejected or cancelled by either endpoint.
            </t>
            <t>
              Multiple types of frames can be sent by either endpoint within 
              a single stream.
            </t>
            <t>
              The order in which frames are sent within a stream is 
              significant. Recipients are required to process frames 
              in the order they are received.
            </t>
            <t>
              Streams optionally carry a set of name-value header pairs
              that are expressed within the headers block of HEADERS+PRIORITY, 
              HEADERS, or PUSH_PROMISE frames.
            </t>
            <t>
              A single SPDY connection can contain multiple concurrently
              active streams, with either endpoint interleaving frames from 
              multiple streams.
            </t>
          </list>
        </t>

        <section anchor="StreamCreation" title="Stream Creation">

          <t>
            There is no coordination or shared action between the client and 
            server required to create a stream. Rather, new streams are 
            established by sending a frame whose stream identifier field 
            references a previously unused stream identifier.
          </t>

          <t>
            All streams are identified by an unsigned 31-bit integer.  Streams 
            initiated by a client use odd numbered stream identifiers; those 
            initiated by the server use even numbered stream identifiers.  
            A stream identifier of zero MUST NOT be used to establish a new
            stream.
          </t>
          
          <t>
            The identifier of a newly established stream MUST be numerically 
            greater than all previously established streams from that endpoint
            within the SPDY connection, unless the identifier has been reserved 
            using a <xref target="PUSH_PROMISE">PUSH_PROMISE</xref> frame.  
            An endpoint that receives an unexpected stream identifier MUST 
            respond with a <xref target="ConnectionErrorHandler">connection error</xref> of type 
            PROTOCOL_ERROR.
          </t>
          
          <t>
            A peer can limit the total number of concurrently active streams 
            using the SETTINGS_MAX_CONCURRENT_STREAMS parameters within a 
            SETTINGS frame. The maximum concurrent streams setting is specific 
            to each endpoint and applies only to the peer. That is, clients 
            specify the maximum number of concurrent streams the server can 
            initiate, and servers specify the maximum number of concurrent 
            streams the client can initiate. Peer endpoints MUST NOT 
            exceed this limit. All concurrently active
            streams initiated by an endpoint, including streams that are 
            <xref target="StreamHalfClose">half-open</xref> in any direction, 
            count toward that endpoint's limit.
          </t>
          
          <t>
            Stream identifiers cannot be reused within a connection.  Long-lived
            connections can cause an endpoint to exhaust the available range of stream
            identifiers. A client that is unable to establish a new stream identifier can
            establish a new connection for new streams.
          </t>

          <t>
            Either endpoint can request the early termination of an unwanted 
            stream by sending an <xref target="StreamErrorHandler">RST_STREAM
            frame</xref> with an error code of either REFUSED_STREAM (if no
            frames have been processed) or CANCEL (if at least one frame has
            been processed). Such termination might not take effect immediately
            as the peer might have sent additional frames on the stream prior 
            to receiving the termination request.

        <section anchor="StreamPriority" title="Stream priority">
          <t>
            The endpoint establishing a new stream can assign a priority for 
            the stream.  Priority is represented as an unsigned 31-bit integer.  
            0 represents the highest priority and 2<x:sup>31</x:sup>-1 represents
            the lowest priority.
          </t>
          
          <t>
            The purpose of this value is to allow the initiating
            endpoint to request that frames for the stream be processed with 
            higher priority relative to any other concurrently active 
            streams. That is, if an endpoint receives interleaved frames
            for multiple streams, the endpoint ought to make a best-effort
            attempt at processing frames for higher priority streams before 
            processing those for lower priority streams.
          </t>
          
          <t>
            Explicitly setting the priority for a stream does not 
            guarantee any particular processing order for the stream
            relative to any other stream. Nor is there is any mechanism 
            provided by which the initiator of a stream can force or require 
            a receiving endpoint to process frames from one stream before 
            processing frames from another.

            When an endpoint sends a frame for a stream with the FINAL flag 
            set, the stream is considered to be half-closed for that endpoint.
            Subsequent frames MUST NOT be sent by that endpoint for the half
            closed stream for the remaining duration of the SPDY connection.
            When both endpoints have sent frames with the FINAL flag set, the
            stream is considered to be fully closed.
          </t>

          <t>
            If an endpoint receives additional frames for a stream that was 
            previously half-closed by the sending peer, the recipient MUST 
            respond with a <xref target="StreamErrorHandler">stream error</xref> 
            of type STREAM_CLOSED.
          </t>
          
          <t>
            An endpoint that has not yet half-closed a stream by sending the
            FINAL flag can continue sending frames on the stream.
          </t>
          
          <t>
            It is not necessary for an endpoint to half-close a stream 
            for which it has not sent any frames. This allows endpoints to
            use fully unidirectional streams that do not require explicit
            action or acknowledgement from the receiver.

            A connection error is any error which prevents further processing of the framing layer or
            which corrupts any connection state.
          </t>
          <t>
            An endpoint that encounters a connection error MUST first send a <xref
            target="GOAWAY">GOAWAY</xref> frame with the stream identifier of the last stream that
            it successfully received from its peer.  The GOAWAY frame includes an error code that
            indicates why the connection is terminating.  After sending the GOAWAY frame, the endpoint
            MUST close the TCP connection.

          <t>
            It is possible that the GOAWAY will not be reliably received by the receiving endpoint.
            In the event of a connection error, GOAWAY only provides a best-effort attempt to
            communicate with the peer about why the connection is being terminated.
          </t>
          <t>
            An endpoint can end a connection at any time.  In particular, an endpoint MAY choose to
            treat a stream error as a connection error if the error is recurrent.  Endpoints SHOULD
            send a GOAWAY frame when ending a connection, as long as circumstances permit it.

            An endpoint that detects a stream error sends a <xref

            A RST_STREAM is the last frame that an endpoint can send on a stream.  The peer that
            sends the RST_STREAM frame MUST be prepared to receive any frames that were sent or
            enqueued for sending by the remote peer.  These frames can be ignored, except where they

            more than a round trip time.  This behavior is permitted to deal with misbehaving

        </t>

        <t>
          At the group level, a map of token-index to key-pair is maintained for each defined group. There is no persistent mapping from stream-id to header-group, instead each HeaderBlock includes reference to the HeaderGroup that will be used in this particular set of metadata.
        </t>

        <t>The HeaderBlock compressor (described later) is subject to the following constraints:

        <t>HG: (Header Group) An 8 bit unsigned integer specifying the header group for this set of headers.</t>
        <t>Ops: A number of operations. Operations will be detailed below.</t>

        <t>
          The Opcode field indicates the type of operation.
          <list>
            <t>0x0 (reserved) -- this is not used and is reserved in case a token-based delimiter is required in the future.</t>
            <t>0x1 (Toggle) indicates that the data which follows will be an lru-index. That lru-index, if present in the current header-group will be removed from the header group. If it is not present in the current header group, it will be added to the current header group. This opcode thus affects what parts of the data stored in the LRU are interpreted as being visible in the current set of headers for whatever frame includes the HeaderBlock</t>
            <t>0x1 (Clone) indicates that the data which follows will be a key-index and a string literal. The key-index is used to refer to a pre-existing key, and thus the operation results in the storing of the pre-existing key and the new value. The key-value will be appended to the LRU, and the index in the LRU added to the current header group.</t>
            <t>0x2 (KVSto) indicates that the data which follows will be two string literals. The first such string represents a new key to be stored, and the second such string represents a value. As with Clone, the key-value will be stored in the LRU with a new index, and that index will be added to the current header group.</t>
            <t>0x2 (Eref)  indicates that the data which follows will be two string literals. The first such string represents key, and the second string represents a value. Unlike KVSto, the Eref does not modify the compressor state-- it only specified a key-value which will be interpreted as being part of the meta-data for the frame which includes the HeaderBlock.</t>
          </list>
        </t>

        <t> String are always encoded as a single bit, followed by data. If that bit is '0', then what follows is 7-bit us-ascii, null-terminated. If that bit is '1', then it is huffman encoded using a canonical huffman-code and ends with an 'eof' character (which is not part of the string). If the last bit of the EOF is not immediately before the byte boundary, the remaining bits of that byte are padded with zero. Strings in a request are encoded with a different huffman-encoder than strings in a response, as the frequency of occurance in these differ by quite a bit.
          <figure>
            <artwork>
              A string is either:
              +-|============================|====================|--------+
              |1| huffman-encoded-characters | huffman-eof-symbol |pad-bits|

          </figure>
        </t>

        <t>
          The NumOps field encodes one minus the number of operations that follow. Since the field-width is 8 bits, a maximum of 256 ops can be represented. If more than 256 operations are required, simply repeat doing this until all operations have been encoded. It is expected that this will be extremely rare.

      <section title="Frame Types" anchor="frame-types">
        
        <t>
          This specification defines a number of frame types, 
          each identified by a unique 8-bit type code. Each frame
          type serves a distinct purpose either in the establishment and 
          management of the connection as a whole, or of individual streams.
        </t>
        
        <t>
          The transmission of specific frame types can alter the state of 
          a connection. If endpoints fail to maintain a synchronized view 
          of the connection state, successful communication within the connection 
          will no longer be possible. Therefore, it is important that endpoints 
          have a shared comprehension of how the state is affected by the use
          any given frame. Accordingly, while it is expected that new frame 
          types will be introduced by extensions to this protocol, only frames
          defined by this document are permitted to alter the connection state.
        </t>

        <section anchor="DataFrames" title="DATA Frames">
          
          <t>
            DATA frames (type=0x0) convey arbitrary, variable-length
            sequences of octets associated with a stream. One or more 
            DATA frames are used, for instance, to carry HTTP request
            or response payloads.
          </t>
          
          <t>
            The DATA frame defines the following flag:
            <list style="hanging">
              <t hangText="MSG_DONE (0x2):">
                Bit 2 being set signifies that this frame represents the last frame of a message.
                This is relevant for layering of message-based protocols on top of SPDY.

            </list>
          </t>

            DATA frames MUST be associated with a stream. If a DATA frame is

            The RST_STREAM frame fully terminates the referenced stream
            and causes it to enter the closed state. After receiving a 
            RST_STREAM on a stream, the receiver MUST NOT send additional 
            frames for that stream. However, after sending the RST_STREAM, 
            the sending endpoint MUST be prepared to receive and process 
            additional frames sent on the stream that might have been sent 
            by the peer prior to the arrival of the RST_STREAM.
          </t>

          <t>
            RST_STREAM frames MUST be associated with a stream. If a 
            RST_STREAM frame is received whose stream

          <t>A SETTINGS frame contains a set of id/value pairs for communicating configuration data about how the two endpoints may communicate. SETTINGS frames can be sent at any time by either endpoint, are optionally sent, and are fully asynchronous.  When the server is the sender, the sender can request that configuration data be persisted by the client across SPDY connections and returned to the server in future communications.</t>

          <t>Persistence of SETTINGS ID/Value pairs is done on a per origin/IP pair (the "origin" is the set of scheme, host, and port from the URI.  See <xref target="RFC6454"></xref>).  That is, when a client connects to a server, and the server persists settings within the client, the client SHOULD return the persisted settings on future connections to the same origin AND IP address and TCP port. Clients MUST NOT request servers to use the persistence features of the SETTINGS frames, and servers MUST ignore persistence related flags sent by a client.</t>

          <t>Length: An unsigned 16-bit value representing the number of bytes which follow the frame header.  For SETTINGS frames, this is the length of the ID/Value-Pairs Block.</t>

          <t>Type: The message type for a SETTINGS message is 4.</t>

          <t>Flags: FLAG_SETTINGS_CLEAR_SETTINGS (0x1): When set, the client should clear any previously persisted SETTINGS ID/Value pairs.  If this frame contains ID/Value pairs with the FLAG_SETTINGS_PERSIST_VALUE set, then the client will first clear its existing, persisted settings, and then persist the values with the flag set which are contained within this frame.

Because persistence is only implemented on the client, this flag is only sent by the server.</t>
              <t>FLAG_SETTINGS_PERSISTED (0x2):  When set, the sender is notifying the recipient that this ID/Value pair was previously sent to the sender by the recipient with the FLAG_SETTINGS_PERSIST_VALUE, and the sender is returning it.  Because persistence is only implemented on the client, this flag is only sent by the client.</t>
            </list>
          </t>

          <t>ID: 24-bits in network byte order.  Defined IDs:
            <list>
              <t>1 - SETTINGS_UPLOAD_BANDWIDTH allows the sender to send its expected upload bandwidth on this channel. This number is an estimate. The value should be the integral number of kilobytes per second that the sender predicts as an expected maximum upload channel capacity.</t>
              <t>2 - SETTINGS_DOWNLOAD_BANDWIDTH allows the sender to send its expected download bandwidth on this channel. This number is an estimate. The value should be the integral number of kilobytes per second that the sender predicts as an expected maximum download channel capacity.</t>
              <t>3 - SETTINGS_ROUND_TRIP_TIME allows the sender to send its expected round-trip-time on this channel. The round trip time is defined as the minimum amount of time to send a control frame from this client to the remote and receive a response. The value is represented in milliseconds.</t>
              <t>4 - SETTINGS_MAX_CONCURRENT_STREAMS allows the sender to inform the remote endpoint the maximum number of concurrent streams which it will allow. By default there is no limit. For implementors it is recommended that this value be no smaller than 100.</t>
              <t>5 - SETTINGS_CURRENT_CWND allows the sender to inform the remote endpoint of the current TCP CWND value.</t>
              <t>6 - SETTINGS_DOWNLOAD_RETRANS_RATE allows the sender to inform the remote endpoint the retransmission rate (bytes retransmitted / total bytes transmitted).</t>
              <t>7 - SETTINGS_INITIAL_WINDOW_SIZE allows the sender to inform the remote endpoint the initial window size (in bytes) for new streams.</t>
              <t>8 - SETTINGS_CLIENT_CERTIFICATE_VECTOR_SIZE allows the server to inform the client if the new size of the client certificate vector.</t>
              <t>9 - SETTINGS_SUPPORTING_SCHEMES allows the sender to inform the remote endpoint supporting overlayering protocol schemes. The corresponding value must be a 32-bit value, and which contains flags as follows:</t>
              <list>
                <t>bit 0: http</t>

            </list>
          </t>

          <t>Value: A 32-bit value.</t>

          <t>The message is intentionally extensible for future information which may improve client-server communications. The sender does not need to send every type of ID/value. It must only send those for which it has accurate values to convey. When multiple ID/value pairs are sent, they should be sent in order of lowest id to highest id.  A single SETTINGS frame MUST not contain multiple values for the same ID.  If the recipient of a SETTINGS frame discovers multiple values for the same ID, it MUST ignore all values except the first one.</t>

          <t>A server may send multiple SETTINGS frames containing different ID/Value pairs.  When the same ID/Value is sent twice, the most recent value overrides any previously sent values.  If the server sends IDs 1, 2, and 3 with the FLAG_SETTINGS_PERSIST_VALUE in a first SETTINGS frame, and then sends IDs 4 and 5 with the FLAG_SETTINGS_PERSIST_VALUE, when the client returns the persisted state on its next SETTINGS frame, it SHOULD send all 5 settings (1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 in this example) to the server.</t>

        <section anchor="GOAWAY" title="GOAWAY">
          <t>
            The GOAWAY frame (type=0x7) informs the remote peer to stop creating
            streams on this connection.  It can be sent from the client or the server. Once sent, the
            sender will ignore frames sent on new streams for the remainder of the
            connection. Receivers of a GOAWAY frame MUST NOT open additional streams on the connection,
            although a new connection can be established for new streams.  The purpose of this message
            is to allow an endpoint to gracefully stop accepting new streams (perhaps for a reboot
            or maintenance), while still finishing processing of previously established streams.
          </t>
          <t>
            There is an inherent race condition between an endpoint starting new streams and the
            remote sending a GOAWAY message.  To deal with this case, the GOAWAY contains the stream
            identifier of the last stream which was processed on the sending endpoint in this
            connection.  If the receiver of the GOAWAY used streams that are newer than the indicated
            stream identifier, they were not processed by the sender and the receiver may treat the
            streams as though they had never been created at all (hence the receiver may want to
            re-create the streams later on a new connection).
          </t>
          <t>
            Endpoints should always send a GOAWAY message before closing a connection so that the
            remote can know whether a stream has been partially processed or not.  (For example, if
            an HTTP client sends a POST at the same time that a server closes a connection, the
            client cannot know if the server started to process that POST request if the server does
            not send a GOAWAY frame to indicate where it stopped working).
          </t>

          <t>
            After sending a GOAWAY message, the sender can ignore frames for new streams.

            Both types of flow control are hop by hop; that is, only between the two endpoints. 
            Intermediaries do not forward WINDOW_UPDATE messages between
            dependent connections.  However, throttling of data transfer by any receiver can
            indirectly cause the propagation of flow control information toward the original

          <section title="The Flow Control Window">
            <t>
              Flow control in SPDY is implemented using a window kept by each sender on every
              stream. The flow control window is a simple integer value that indicates how many
              bytes of data the sender is permitted to transmit; as such, its size is a
              measure of the buffering capability of the receiver.
            </t>
            <t>
              Two flow control windows are applicable; the stream flow
              control window and the connection flow control window.  The sender MUST NOT send a flow
              controlled frame with a length that exceeds the space available in either of the flow
              control windows advertised by the receiver.  Frames with zero length with the FINAL
              flag set (for example, an empty data frame) MAY be sent if there is no available space
              in either flow control window.
            </t>
            <t>
              For flow control calculations, the 8 byte frame header is not counted.
            </t>
            <t>
              After sending a flow controlled frame, the sender reduces the space available in both
              windows by the length of the transmitted frame.
            </t>
            <t>
              The receiver of a message sends a WINDOW_UPDATE frame as it consumes data and frees up
              space in flow control windows.  Separate WINDOW_UPDATE messages are sent for the
              stream and connection level flow control windows.
            </t>
            <t>
              A sender that receives a WINDOW_UPDATE frame updates the corresponding window by the
              amount specified in the frame.
            </t>
            <t>
              A sender MUST NOT allow a flow control window to exceed 2<x:sup>31</x:sup> - 1 bytes.
              If a sender receives a WINDOW_UPDATE that causes a flow control window to exceed this
              maximum it MUST terminate either the stream or the connection, as appropriate.  For
              streams, the sender sends a RST_STREAM with the error code of FLOW_CONTROL_ERROR code;
              for the connection, a GOAWAY message with a FLOW_CONTROL_ERROR code.
            </t>
            <t>
              Flow controlled frames from the sender and WINDOW_UPDATE frames from the receiver are
              completely asynchronous with respect to each other. This property allows a receiver to
              aggressively update the window size kept by the sender to prevent streams from
              stalling.

          <section title="Initial Flow Control Window Size">
            <t>
              When a SPDY connection is first established, new streams are created with an
              initial flow control window size of 65535 bytes. The connection flow control window is
              65536 bytes.  Both endpoints can adjust the initial window size for new streams by
              including a value for SETTINGS_INITIAL_WINDOW_SIZE in the SETTINGS frame that forms
              part of the connection header.
            </t>
            <t>
              Prior to receiving a SETTINGS frame that sets a value for
              SETTINGS_INITIAL_WINDOW_SIZE, a client can only use the default initial window size
              when sending flow controlled frames.  Similarly, the connection flow control window is
              set to the default initial window size until a WINDOW_UPDATE message is received.
            </t>
            <t>
              A SETTINGS frame can alter the initial flow control window size for all current
              streams. When the value of SETTINGS_INITIAL_WINDOW_SIZE changes, a receiver MUST
              adjust the size of all flow control windows that it maintains by the difference
              between the new value and the old value.
            </t>
            <t>
              A change to SETTINGS_INITIAL_WINDOW_SIZE could cause the available space in a flow
              control window to become negative.  A sender MUST track the negative flow control
              window, and MUST NOT send new flow controlled frames until it receives WINDOW_UPDATE
              messages that cause the flow control window to become positive.
            </t>
            <t>
              For example, if the server sets the initial window size to be 16KB, and the client
              sends 64KB immediately on connection establishment, the client will recalculate the
              available flow control window to be -48KB on receipt of the SETTINGS frame.  The
              client retains a negative flow control window until WINDOW_UPDATE frames restore the
              window to being positive, after which the client can resume sending.
            </t>
          </section>

          <section title="Reducing the Stream Window Size">
            <t>
              A receiver that wishes to use a smaller flow control window than the current size
              can send a new SETTINGS frame.  However, the receiver MUST be prepared to receive data
              that exceeds this window size, since the sender might send data that exceeds the lower
              limit prior to processing the SETTINGS frame.
            </t>
            <t>
              A receiver has two options for handling streams that exceed flow control limits:
              <list style="numbers">
                <t>
                  The receiver can immediately send RST_STREAM with FLOW_CONTROL_ERROR error code

                </t>
                <t>

                </t>
              </list>

              stream with a FINAL flag set), it ceases transmission of WINDOW_UPDATE frames. A
              sender is not required to maintain the available flow control window for streams that
              it is no longer sending on.
            </t>
            <t>
              Flow control can be disabled for all streams or the connection using the
              SETTINGS_FLOW_CONTROL_OPTIONS setting.  An implementation that does not wish to
              perform flow control can use this in the initial SETTINGS exchange.
            </t>
            <t>
              Flow control can be disabled for an individual stream or the overall connection by
              sending a WINDOW_UPDATE with the END_FLOW_CONTROL flag set.  The payload of a
              WINDOW_UPDATE frame that has the END_FLOW_CONTROL flag set is ignored.
            </t>
            <t>
              Flow control cannot be enabled again once disabled.  Any attempt to re-enable flow
              control - by sending a WINDOW_UPDATE or by clearing the bits on the
              SETTINGS_FLOW_CONTROL_OPTIONS setting - MUST be rejected with a FLOW_CONTROL_ERROR
              error code.

        <section anchor="CREDENTIAL" title="CREDENTIAL">
          <t>The CREDENTIAL control frame is used by the client to send additional client certificates to the server.  A SPDY client may decide to send requests for resources from different origins on the same SPDY connection if it decides that that server handles both origins.  For example if the IP address associated with both hostnames matches and the SSL server certificate presented in the initial handshake is valid for both hostnames.  However, because the SSL connection can contain at most one client certificate, the client needs a mechanism to send additional client certificates to the server.</t>

          <t>The server is required to maintain a vector of client certificates associated with a SPDY connection.  When the client needs to send a client certificate to the server, it will send a CREDENTIAL frame that specifies the index of the slot in which to store the certificate as well as proof that the client posesses the corresponding private key.  The initial size of this vector must be 8.  If the client provides a client certificate during the first TLS handshake, the contents of this certificate must be copied into the first slot (index 1) in the CREDENTIAL vector, though it may be overwritten by subsequent CREDENTIAL frames.  The server must exclusively use the CREDENTIAL vector when evaluating the client certificates associated with an origin.  The server may change the size of this vector by sending a SETTINGS frame with the setting SETTINGS_CLIENT_CERTIFICATE_VECTOR_SIZE value specified.  In the event that the new size is smaller than the current size, truncation occurs preserving lower-index slots as possible.</t>  

          <t>TLS renegotiation with client authentication is incompatible with SPDY given the multiplexed nature of SPDY.  Specifically, imagine that the client has 2 requests outstanding to the server for two different pages (in different tabs).  When the renegotiation + client certificate request comes in, the browser is unable to determine which resource triggered the client certificate request, in order to prompt the user accordingly.</t>

          <t>Slot: The index in the server's client certificate vector where this certificate should be stored.  If there is already a certificate stored at this index, it will be overwritten.  The index is one based, not zero based; zero is an invalid slot index.</t>
          <t>Proof: Cryptographic proof that the client has possession of the private key associated with the certificate.  The format is a TLS digitally-signed element (http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5246#section-4.7).  The signature algorithm must be the same as that used in the CertificateVerify message.  However, since the MD5+SHA1 signature type used in TLS 1.0 connections can not be correctly encoded in a digitally-signed element, SHA1 must be used when MD5+SHA1 was used in the SSL connection.  The signature is calculated over a 32 byte TLS extractor value (http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5705) with a label of "EXPORTER SPDY certificate proof" using the empty string as context. ForRSA certificates the signature would be a PKCS#1 v1.5 signature. For ECDSA, it would be an ECDSA-Sig-Value (http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5480#appendix-A).  For a 1024-bit RSA key, the CREDENTIAL message would be ~500 bytes.</t>
          <t>Certificate: The certificate chain, starting with the leaf certificate.  Each certificate must be encoded as a 32 bit length, followed by a DER encoded certificate.  The certificate must be of the same type (RSA, ECDSA, etc) as the client certificate associated with the SSL connection.</t>
          <t>If the server receives a request for a resource with unacceptable credential (either missing or invalid), it must reply with a RST_STREAM frame with the status code INVALID_CREDENTIALS. Upon receipt of a RST_STREAM frame with INVALID_CREDENTIALS, the client should initiate a new stream directly to the requested origin and resend the request.  Note, SPDY does not allow the server to request different client authentication for different resources in the same origin.</t>
          <t>If the server receives an invalid CREDENTIAL frame, it MUST respond with a GOAWAY frame and shutdown the connection.  </t>

    <section anchor="HTTPLayer" title="HTTP Layering over SPDY">
      <t>SPDY is intended to be as compatible as possible with current web-based applications. This means that, from the perspective of the server business logic or application API, the features of HTTP are unchanged. To achieve this, all of the application request and response header semantics are preserved, although the syntax of conveying those semantics has changed.  Thus, the rules from the <xref target="RFC2616">HTTP/1.1 specification in RFC2616</xref> apply with the changes in the sections below.</t>

      <section title="Connection Management">
        <t>Clients SHOULD NOT open more than one SPDY connection to a given <xref target="RFC6454">origin</xref> concurrently.</t>
        <t>Note that it is possible for one SPDY connection to be finishing (e.g. a GOAWAY message has been sent, but not all streams have finished), while another SPDY connection is starting.</t>
        <section title="Use of GOAWAY">
          <t>SPDY provides a GOAWAY message which can be used when closing a connection from either the client or server.  Without a server GOAWAY message, HTTP has a race condition where the client sends a request (a new HEADERS+PRIORITY)  just as the server is closing the connection, and the client cannot know if the server received the stream or not.  By using the last-stream-id in the GOAWAY, servers can indicate to the client if a request was processed or not.</t>

          <t>Note that some servers will choose to send the GOAWAY and immediately terminate the connection without waiting for active streams to finish.  The client will be able to determine this because SPDY streams are determinstically closed.  This abrupt termination will force the client to heuristically decide whether to retry the pending requests.  Clients always need to be capable of dealing with this case because they must deal with accidental connection termination cases, which are the same as the server never having sent a GOAWAY.</t>

          <t>More sophisticated servers will use GOAWAY to implement a graceful teardown. They will send the GOAWAY and provide some time for the active streams to finish before terminating the connection.</t>

          <t>If a SPDY client closes the connection, it should also send a GOAWAY message.  This allows the server to know if any server-push streams were received by the client.</t>

          <t>If the endpoint closing the connection has not received any HEADERS+PRIORITY from the remote, the GOAWAY will contain a last-stream-id of 0.</t>

        </section>
      </section>

      <section title="HTTP Request/Response">
        <section title="Request">
          <t>The client initiates a request by sending a HEADERS+PRIORITY frame.  For requests which do not contain a body, the HEADERS+PRIORITY frame MUST set the FLAG_FIN, indicating that the client intends to send no further data on this stream.  For requests which do contain a body, the HEADERS+PRIORITY will not contain the FLAG_FIN, and the body will follow the HEADERS+PRIORITY in a series of DATA frames. The last DATA frame will set the FLAG_FIN to indicate the end of the body.</t>

          <t>The HEADERS+PRIORITY Name/Value section will contain all of the HTTP headers which are associated with an HTTP request. The header block in SPDY is mostly unchanged from today's HTTP header block, with the following differences:
            <list>
              <t>The first line of the request is unfolded into name/value pairs like other HTTP headers and MUST be present:
                <list>
                  <t>":method" - the HTTP method for this request (e.g. "GET", "POST", "HEAD", etc)</t>
                  <t>":path" - the url-path for this url with "/" prefixed. (See <xref target="RFC3986">RFC3986</xref>).  For example, for "http://www.google.com/search?q=dogs" the path would be "/search?q=dogs".</t>
                  <t>":version" - the HTTP version of this request (e.g. "HTTP/1.1")</t>
                </list>
              </t>
              <t>In addition, the following two name/value pairs must also be present in every request:
                <list>
                  <t>":host" - the hostport (See <xref target="RFC1738">RFC1738</xref>) portion of the URL for this request (e.g. "www.google.com:1234"). This header is the same as the HTTP 'Host' header. </t>
                  <t>":scheme" - the scheme portion of the URL for this request (e.g. "https"))</t>
              </list></t>
              <t>Header names are all lowercase.</t>
              <t>The Connection, Host, Keep-Alive, Proxy-Connection, and Transfer-Encoding headers are not valid and MUST not be sent.</t>
              <t>User-agents MUST support gzip compression. Regardless of the Accept-Encoding sent by the user-agent, the server may always send content encoded with gzip or deflate encoding.</t>
              <t>If a server receives a request where the sum of the data frame payload lengths does not equal the size of the Content-Length header, the server MUST return a 400 (Bad Request) error.</t>
              <t>POST-specific changes:
                <list>
                  <t>Although POSTs are inherently chunked, POST requests SHOULD also be accompanied by a Content-Length header.  There are two reasons for this:  First, it assists with upload progress meters for an improved user experience.  But second, we know from early versions of SPDY that failure to send a content length header is incompatible with many existing HTTP server implementations.  Existing user-agents do not omit the Content-Length header, and server implementations have come to depend upon this.</t>
                </list>
              </t>
            </list>
          </t>

          <t>The user-agent is free to prioritize requests as it sees fit. If the user-agent cannot make progress without receiving a resource, it should attempt to raise the priority of that resource. Resources such as images, SHOULD generally use the lowest priority.</t>

          <t>If a client sends a HEADERS+PRIORITY without all of the method, host, path, scheme, and version headers, the server MUST reply with a HTTP 400 Bad Request reply.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Response">
          <t>The server responds to a client request with a HEADERS frame. Symmetric to the client's upload stream, server will send data after the HEADERS frame via a series of DATA frames, and the last data frame will contain the FLAG_FIN to indicate successful end-of-stream.  If a response (like a 202 or 204 response) contains no body, the HEADERS frame may contain the FLAG_FIN flag to indicate no further data will be sent on the stream.</t>

          <t>
            <list>
              <t>The response status line is unfolded into name/value pairs like other HTTP headers and must be present:
                <list>
                  <t>":status" - The HTTP response status code (e.g. "200" or "200 OK")</t>
                  <t>":version" - The HTTP response version (e.g. "HTTP/1.1")</t>
                </list>

              <t>All header names must be lowercase.</t>

              <t>Responses MAY be accompanied by a Content-Length header for advisory purposes.  (e.g. for UI progress meters)</t>
              <t>If a client receives a response where the sum of the data frame payload lengths does not equal the size of the Content-Length header, the client MUST ignore the content length header.</t>
            </list>
          </t>

          <t>If a client receives a HEADERS frame without a status or without a version header, the client must reply with a RST_STREAM frame indicating a PROTOCOL ERROR.</t>

        <section title="Authentication" anchor="Authentication">
          <t>When a client sends a request to an origin server that requires authentication, the server can reply with a "401 Unauthorized" response, and include a WWW-Authenticate challenge header that defines the authentication scheme to be used.  The client then retries the request with an Authorization header appropriate to the specified authentication scheme.</t>

          <t>There are four options for proxy authentication, Basic, Digest, NTLM and Negotiate (SPNEGO).  The first two options were defined in <xref target="RFC2617">RFC2617</xref>, and are stateless.  The second two options were developed by Microsoft and specified in <xref target="RFC4559">RFC4559</xref>, and are stateful; otherwise known as multi-round authentication, or connection authentication.</t>

          <section title="Stateless Authentication">
            <t>Stateless Authentication over SPDY is identical to how it is performed over HTTP. If multiple SPDY streams are concurrently sent to a single server, each will authenticate independently, similar to how two HTTP connections would independently authenticate to a proxy server.</t>
          </section>

          <section title="Stateful Authentication">
            <t>Unfortunately, the stateful authentication mechanisms were implemented and defined in a such a way that directly violates RFC2617 - they do not include a "realm" as part of the request.  This is problematic in SPDY because it makes it impossible for a client to disambiguate two concurrent server authentication challenges.</t>

            <t>To deal with this case, SPDY servers using Stateful Authentication MUST implement one of two changes:
              <list>
                <t>Servers can add a "realm=&lt;desired realm&gt;" header so that the two authentication requests can be disambiguated and run concurrently.  Unfortunately, given how these mechanisms work, this is probably not practical.</t>
                <t>Upon sending the first stateful challenge response, the server MUST buffer and defer all further frames which are not part of completing the challenge until the challenge has completed.  Completing the authentication challenge may take multiple round trips.  Once the client receives a "401 Authenticate" response for a stateful authentication type, it MUST stop sending new requests to the server until the authentication has completed by receiving a non-401 response on at least one stream.</t>

      <section title="Server Push Transactions">
        <t>SPDY enables a server to send multiple replies to a client for a single request.  The rationale for this feature is that sometimes a server knows that it will need to send multiple resources in response to a single request and would otherwise be forced to inline the images into the document.  Without server push features, the server must inline, or the client must first download the primary resource, then discover the secondary resource(s), and request them.  Pushing of resources avoids the round-trip delay, but also creates a potential race where a server can be pushing content which a user-agent is in the process of requesting.  The following mechanics attempt to prevent the race condition while enabling the performance benefit. Server push is designed to be strictly better than inlining.</t>

        <t>Browsers receiving a pushed response MUST validate that the server is authorized to push the URL using the <xref target="RFC6454">browser same-origin</xref> policy, or by verifying that the server has proven (via SSL handshake or CERTIFICATE frame) that it has the certificate for the domain of the pushed content.  For example, a SPDY connection to www.foo.com is generally not permitted to push a response for www.evil.com. A SPDY connection to www.foo.com would be allowed to push images.foo.com, however, assuming the cert provided at the SSL handshake was a wildcard cert encoding *.foo.com</t>

        <t>If the browser accepts a pushed response (e.g. it does not send a RST_STREAM), the browser MUST attempt to cache the pushed response in same way that it would cache any other response.  This means validating the response headers and inserting into the cache.</t>

        <t>Because pushed responses have no request, they have no request headers associated with them.  At the framing layer, SPDY pushed streams contain an "associated-stream-id" which indicates the requested stream for which the pushed stream is related.  The pushed stream inherits all of the headers from the associated-stream-id with the exception of ":host", ":scheme", and ":path", which are provided as part of the pushed response stream headers.  The browser MUST store these inherited and implied request headers with the cached resource.</t>

        <t>Implementation note:  Similarly with inlining, with server push it is theoretically possible for servers to push large amounts of content or resources to the user-agent.  Browsers MUST implement throttles to protect against unreasonable push attacks, just as they must react reasonably to abuse of inlining. The server-push mechanism should make this easier to deal with than inlining in basically every case.</t>

        <section title="Server implementation">
          <t>When the server intends to push a resource to the user-agent, it promises that it will opens a new stream in the future (but not now) by sending a PUSH_PROMISE frame.  The PUSH_PROMISE frame MUST include an Associated-To-Stream-ID, Prmoised-Stream-ID, and MUST ensure that headers for ":scheme", ":host", ":path" representing the URL for the resource being pushed are either already present in the implied headers context (i.e. the request headers), or it must override the headers which do not match the pushed resource. The ":path" MUST always be different from the originally request resource.  The stream-IDs represented in the Promised-Stream-ID field MUST NOT count towards the MAX_CONCURRENT_STREAMS limit. When the server is ready to send the resource, it will send a HEADERS frame with the stream-ID indicated by the Promised-Stream-ID sent in the PUSH_PROMISE frame earlier. As with any other HEADERS frame, subsequent headers may follow in other HEADERS frames. The purpose of the association is so that the user-agent can differentiate which request induced the pushed stream; without it, if the user-agent had two tabs open to the same page, each pushing unique content under a fixed URL, the user-agent would not be able to differentiate the requests.</t>

          <t>The Associated-To-Stream-ID must be the ID of an existing, open stream.  The reason for this restriction is to have a clear endpoint for pushed content.  If the user-agent requested a resource on stream 11, the server replies on stream 11.  It can push any number of additional streams to the client before sending a FLAG_FIN on stream 11.  However, once the originating stream is closed no further push streams may be associated with it.  The pushed streams do not need to be closed (FIN set) before the originating stream is closed, they only need to be created before the originating stream closes.</t>

          <t>To prevent a race condition with the client, the server must only use the client certificate of the associated stream when pushing resources.</t>

          <t>It is illegal for a server to push a resource with the Associated-To-Stream-ID of 0, or with a Slot that is not 0.</t>

          <t>To minimize race conditions with the client, the HEADERS+PRIORITY for the pushed resources MUST be sent prior to sending any content which could allow the client to discover the pushed resource and request it.</t>

          <t>The server MUST only push resources which would have been returned from a GET request.</t>

          <t>Note:  If the server does not have all of the Name/Value Response headers available at the time it issues the HEADERS frame for the pushed resource, it may later use an additional HEADERS frame to augment the name/value pairs to be associated with the pushed stream.  The subsequent HEADERS frame(s) must not contain a header for ':host', ':scheme', or ':path' (e.g. the server can't change the identity of the resource to be pushed).  The HEADERS frame must not contain duplicate headers with a previously sent HEADERS frame.  The server must send a HEADERS frame including the scheme/host/port headers before sending any data frames on the stream.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Client implementation">
          <t>When fetching a resource the client has 3 possibilities:
            <list>
              <t>the resource is not being pushed</t>
              <t>the resource is being pushed, but the data has not yet arrived</t>

          <t>To cancel individual server push streams, the client can issue a <xref target="StreamErrorHandler">stream error</xref> with error code CANCEL.  Upon receipt, the server MUST stop sending on this stream immediately (this is an Abrupt termination).</t> 

          <t>To cancel all server push streams related to a request, the client may issue a <xref target="StreamErrorHandler">stream error</xref> with error code CANCEL on the associated-stream-id.  By cancelling that stream, the server MUST immediately stop sending frames for any streams with in-association-to for the original stream.</t>

          <t>If the server sends a HEADER frame containing duplicate headers with a previous HEADERS frame for the same stream, the client must issue a <xref target="StreamErrorHandler">stream error</xref> with error code PROTOCOL ERROR.</t>

          <t>If the server sends a HEADERS frame after sending a data frame for the same stream, the client MAY ignore the HEADERS frame.

The GOAWAY control frame with non-zero status code SHOULD be also handled in the same way. The status code of RST_STREAM and GOAWAY frames SHOULD be encoded to UTF-8 string with its frame type for its reason field. (e.g. “SPDY/3 RST_STREAM (5)” or “SPDY/3 GOAWAY (1)”)</t>

        <section title="Frame mapping">

          <t>One WebSocket frame is mapped into one proceeding SPDY HEADERS frame and following plural SPDY data frames. The SPDY HEADERS frame must contain WebSocket frame fields and following SPDY data frames contain payload data. These data frames are free to be reframed.</t>

    <section title="Design Rationale and Notes">
      <t>Authors' notes:  The notes in this section have no bearing on the SPDY protocol as specified within this document, and none of these notes should be considered authoritative about how the protocol works.  However, these notes may prove useful in future debates about how to resolve protocol ambiguities or how to evolve the protocol going forward.  They may be removed before the final draft.</t>

      <section title="Separation of Framing Layer and Application Layer">
        <t>Readers may note that this specification sometimes blends the <xref target="FramingLayer">framing layer</xref> with requirements of a specific application - <xref target="HTTPLayer">HTTP</xref>.  This is reflected in the request/response nature of the streams, the definition of the HEADERS and compression contexts which are very similar to HTTP, and other areas as well.</t>

        <t>This blending is intentional - the primary goal of this protocol is to create a low-latency protocol for use with HTTP.  Isolating the two layers is convenient for description of the protocol and how it relates to existing HTTP implementations.  However, the ability to reuse the SPDY framing layer is a non goal.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Error handling - Framing Layer">
        <t>Error handling at the SPDY layer splits errors into two groups:  Those that affect an individual SPDY stream, and those that do not.</t>

        <t>When an error is confined to a single stream, but general framing is in tact, SPDY attempts to use the RST_STREAM as a mechanism to invalidate the stream but move forward without aborting the connection altogether.</t>

        <t>For errors occuring outside of a single stream context, SPDY assumes the entire connection is hosed.  In this case, the endpoint detecting the error should initiate a connection close.</t>
      </section>
      <section title="One Connection Per Domain">
        <t>SPDY attempts to use fewer connections than other protocols have traditionally used.  The rationale for this behavior is because it is very difficult to provide a consistent level of service (e.g. TCP slow-start), prioritization, or optimal compression when the client is connecting to the server through multiple channels.</t>

        <t>Through lab measurements, we have seen consistent latency benefits by using fewer connections from the client.  The overall number of packets sent by SPDY can be as much as 40% less than HTTP.  Handling large numbers of concurrent connections on the server also does become a scalability problem, and SPDY reduces this load.</t>

        <t>The use of multiple connections is not without benefit, however.  Because SPDY multiplexes multiple, independent streams onto a single stream, it creates a potential for head-of-line blocking problems at the transport level.  In tests so far, the negative effects of head-of-line blocking (especially in the presence of packet loss) is outweighed by the benefits of compression and prioritization.</t>
      </section>
      <section title="Fixed vs Variable Length Fields">
        <t>SPDY favors use of fixed length 32bit fields in cases where smaller, variable length encodings could have been used.  To some, this seems like a tragic waste of bandwidth.  SPDY choses the simple encoding for speed and simplicity.</t>

        <t>The goal of SPDY is to reduce latency on the network.  The overhead of SPDY frames is generally quite low.  Each data frame is only an 8 byte overhead for a 1452 byte payload (~0.6%).  At the time of this writing, bandwidth is already plentiful, and there is a strong trend indicating that bandwidth will continue to increase.  With an average worldwide bandwidth of 1Mbps, and assuming that a variable length encoding could reduce the overhead by 50%, the latency saved by using a variable length encoding would be less than 100 nanoseconds.  More interesting are the effects when the larger encodings force a packet boundary, in which case a round-trip could be induced.  However, by addressing other aspects of SPDY and TCP interactions, we believe this is completely mitigated.</t>
      </section>
      <section title="Compression Context(s)">
        <t>When isolating the compression contexts used for communicating with multiple origins, we had a few choices to make.  We could have maintained a map (or list) of compression contexts usable for each origin.  The basic case is easy - each HEADERS frame would need to identify the context to use for that frame.  However, compression contexts are not cheap, so the lifecycle of each context would need to be bounded.  For proxy servers, where we could churn through many contexts, this would be a concern.  We considered using a static set of contexts, say 16 of them, which would bound the memory use.  We also considered dynamic contexts, which could be created on the fly, and would need to be subsequently destroyed.  All of these are complicated, and ultimately we decided that such a mechanism creates too many problems to solve.</t>

        <t>Alternatively, we've chosen the simple approach, which is to simply provide a flag for resetting the compression context.  For the common case (no proxy), this fine because most requests are to the same origin and we never need to reset the context.  For cases where we are using two different origins over a single SPDY connection, we simply reset the compression state between each transition.</t>
      </section>
      <section title="Unidirectional streams">
        <t>Besides providing a clear endpoint for unidirectional streams, Associated-To-Stream-ID also avoids the recipient of pushed streams from needing to send a set of empty frames (e.g. the HEADERS+PRIORITY w/ FLAG_FIN) to signal that it doesn't wish to send data on the stream.</t>
      </section>
      <section title="Data Compression">
        <t>Generic compression of data portion of the streams (as opposed to compression of the headers) without knowing the content of the stream is redundant.  There is no value in compressing a stream which is already compressed.  Because of this, SPDY initially allowed data compression to be optional.  We included it because study of existing websites shows that many sites are not using compression as they should, and users suffer because of it.  We wanted a mechanism where, at the SPDY layer, site administrators could simply force compression - it is better to compress twice than to not compress.</t>

        <t>Overall, however, with this feature being optional and sometimes redundant, it was unclear if it was useful at all.  We removed it from the specification.</t>
      </section>
      <section title="Server Push">
        <t>A subtle but important point is that server push streams must be declared before the associated stream is closed.  The reason for this is so that proxies have a lifetime for which they can discard information about previous streams.  If a pushed stream could associate itself with an already-closed stream, then endpoints would not have a specific lifecycle for when they could disavow knowledge of the streams which went before.</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="Security Considerations">
      <section title="Use of Same-origin constraints">
        <t>This specification uses the <xref target="RFC6454">same-origin policy</xref> in all cases where verification of content is required.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="HTTP Headers and SPDY Headers">
        <t>At the application level, HTTP uses name/value pairs in its headers.  Because SPDY merges the existing HTTP headers with SPDY headers, there is a possibility that some HTTP applications already use a particular header name.  To avoid any conflicts, all headers introduced for layering HTTP over SPDY are prefixed with ":".  ":" is not a valid sequence in HTTP header naming, preventing any possible conflict.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Cross-Protocol Attacks">
        <t>By utilizing TLS, we believe that SPDY introduces no new cross-protocol attacks.  TLS encrypts the contents of all transmission (except the handshake itself), making it difficult for attackers to control the data which could be used in a cross-protocol attack.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Server Push Implicit Headers">
        <t>Pushed resources do not have an associated request.  In order for existing HTTP cache control validations (such as the Vary header) to work, however, all cached resources must have a set of request headers.  For this reason, browsers MUST be careful to inherit request headers from the associated stream for the push.  This includes the 'Cookie' header.</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="Privacy Considerations">
      <section title="Long Lived Connections">
        <t>SPDY aims to keep connections open longer between clients and servers in order to reduce the latency when a user makes a request.  The maintenance of these connections over time could be used to expose private information.  For example, a user using a browser hours after the previous user stopped using that browser may be able to learn about what the previous user was doing.  This is a problem with HTTP in its current form as well, however the short lived connections make it less of a risk.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="SETTINGS frame">
        <t>The SPDY SETTINGS frame allows servers to store out-of-band transmitted information about the communication between client and server on the client.  Although this is intended only to be used to reduce latency, renegade servers could use it as a mechanism to store identifying information about the client in future requests.</t>

        <t>Clients implementing privacy modes, such as Google Chrome's "incognito mode", may wish to disable client-persisted SETTINGS storage.</t>

        <t>Clients MUST clear persisted SETTINGS information when clearing the cookies.</t>

        <t>TODO: Put range maximums on each type of setting to limit inappropriate uses.</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="Sub-protocol negotiation">
      <section title="Supporting scheme negotiation using SETTINGS frame">

        <t>By default, a client can send HEADERS+PRIORITY frames on http and https schemes, but if it want to send them on other schemes, it MUST wait for a server sending SETTINGS frame which specify declaring schemes. Thus, a server SHOULD send a SETTINGS frame as soon as possible whether it supports other schemes or not.</t>

    <section title="Incompatibilities with SPDY draft #3">
      <t>
        Here is a list of the major changes between this draft #3 and this draft
        <list>

          <t>DONE: Different, more precise, notation style used to describe all frames.</t>
          <t>DONE: Downsizing various fields in all messages... this will definitely need debate</t>
          <t>DONE: Removal of Version field from all messages.</t>
          <t>DONE: Reordered fields in all messages. All messages now share a common header of: length, flags, control-bit, 31-bit-payload. All control frames include an 8th byte, which is the opcode.</t>
          <t>DONE: Addition of end-of-message delimiter flag in data frames</t>
          <t>DONE: Modification of server push; addition of PUSH_PROMISE frame add a push frame, removed the 'associated-stream-id' field from SYN frame</t>

          <t>ONGOING: Significant modifications to how headers are transported. This involved changes to all frames incorporating HEADER blocks, and changes to the HEADER blocks themselves.</t>
          <t>ONGOING: Different header compression technique which uses less CPU for proxies and which should result in competitive compression</t>
          <t>TODO: Addition of end-of-header-section delimiter flag in any frame which has a header block</t>

          <t>ONGOING: Definition of cert-data push</t>
          <t>ONGOING: Definition of name-resolution push</t>
          <t>ONGOING: Redefining prioritization</t>

          <t>TODO: Modification of flow-control; allow two-levels of flow control so as to allow greater stream concurrency safely</t>
          <t>TODO: Add the 'blocked-on-flow-control' notification. Experience has shown that limits are too easy to get wrong, and this helps to self-correct this problem</t>
          <t>TODO: Modification of flow-control; headers-blocks (thus syn-stream) gets its own pool of memory, separate from data frames</t>
          <t>TODO: Everything after the first header-block-section possibly treated as flow-control</t>
          <t>TODO: Connection-error status code added for UNRECOGNIZED_SCHEME for new streams. This triggers when the recipient doesn't know how to handle a stream of that type.</t>
