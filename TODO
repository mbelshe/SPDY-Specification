TODO LIST

[ ] rename GOAWAY to GOODBYE

[ ] replace PROTOCOL_ERROR with specific errors

[ ] figure out the right way to reference zlib compression

[ ] for duplicate RST_STREAM cases, suppress the multiple, duplicate frames
    into just one (e.g when multiple data frames are received in a row for the
    same dead stream

[ ] Require that stream-ids start at 1/2 and always increase by 2 for each new
    stream?

[ ] Unidirectional streams are half-closed from the start - how to do
    window-update frames?

[ ] Kinda lame that name/value pair blocks use 32bit values but are confined to
    a 24bit length frame

[ ] Should we restrict compression settings to avoid clients causing large
    memory footprints on server decompressors?

[ ] Consider mitigations against DoS attacks by way of huge headers blocks?
    Should flow control apply to HEADER frames?

[ ] Eliminate the no-duplicate and lower case header shenanigans
