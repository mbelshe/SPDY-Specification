Of the python stuff, headers_sample.py is what you want to look at. The rest of
the python code exists to support it.

usage:
  ./headers_sample.py list-of-har-files

A spec for .har files can be found here:
  https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/http-archive-specification
(somewhere).

You can gather a .har file for a session you wish to analyze with Chome
Developer tools: hit <ctrl>-<shift>-I, click on the 'network' tab, and then
navigate to a page you wish to analyse.  When it has loaded, right-click
someonwere in there, and select the 'save all as HAR'. This will save all
request and response headers as well as some other information in there.


The c++ code is not yet finished, though some of the code is functional.
