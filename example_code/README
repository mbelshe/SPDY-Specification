Of the python stuff, headers_sample.py is what you want to look at. The rest of
the python code exists to support it.

usage:
  ./headers_sample.py list-of-har-files

A spec for .har files can be found here:
  https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/http-archive-specification
(somewhere).

If you wish to implement a new codec and test it, there are two easy approaches.
1) Develop it in python, and load it into a module. An examination of
headers_sample.py should show how this is done. http1_gzip.py is a good example.
2) Develop it in whatever language, and use the 'fork_codec' module to fork-exec
it in a separate process, and communicate to/from it with pipes. A short example
of a program that could be fork-exec'd is 'trivial_codec.py', which accepts
HTTP1 formatted input from stdin, and produces 8-byte unsigned int-followed by
compressed-payload for each HTTP frame on stdout.


You can gather a .har file for a session you wish to analyze with Chome's
Developer Tools:
While using Chrome, hit <ctrl>-<shift>-I, click on the 'network' tab, and then
navigate to a page you wish to analyse.  When it has loaded, right-click
somewhere in there, and select the 'save all as HAR'. This will save all
request and response headers as well as some other information in the specified
HAR file.


The c++ code is not yet finished, though some of the code is functional.
It will compute delta-codings and timings, but doesn't yet do serialization,
deserialization, or decompression.
The c++ code depends on "harfile_translator.py", so don't remove it if you wish
to experiment with it.
